# Requirements for installation

## Unlock bootloader
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
### Your device will have poor security, some Samsung functions will not work and it will be reset to factory settings blah blah blah :v
You already know the process for those who are experienced for that, for those who are new (like me) I will give you a guide:

1. Go to **Settings > About phone** and tap **Build number** 3 or more times to enable **Developer mode**.
2. Go back to **Settings**, open **Developer options**, and enable **OEM unlocking**. Enter your password if prompted.
3. Restart the device and quickly connect a **USB OTG** or USB cable to your computer.
4. While connecting, press **Volume Up + Volume Down** buttons simultaneously to enter **Odin mode**.
5. In Odin mode, press the volume up button to **unlock the bootloader**. The device will restart and reset to factory settings.

That's it! Your device will have the bootloader unlocked.

## Stock ROM (the original firmware)
For those who are using custom ROM, unfortunately you have to put STOCK ROM :(
You can find your firmware on the SM-G780F device page: [*samfw SM-G780F*](https://samfw.com/firmware/SM-G780F)

## Disable vbmeta
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
### It will be reset to factory settings
- Simple and easy just use your vbmeta and boot image of your firmware (Stock) which you probably still have downloaded
- Compress it in .tar format
- Use magisk to patch it will give you a new vbmeta image with the boot image
- There are two methods: on the computer [Odin3](https://samfw.com/Odin/Odin3_v3.13.1_3B_Patched_Samfw.com.rar) and with another device using [Heimdoo](https://github.com/RohitVerma882/Heimdoo/releases/download/v1.8/app-release.apk), to flash vbmeta image.
- Return your device to Odin mode, then press volume up

- Connect your cable to your device; Odin3 should recognize the connected USB.
- In AB, place the compressed .tar file.
- Then click "Start", and your device will automatically reboot after that.
And that's it!

You'll need to run commands to flash the vbmeta image in the application. Unzip the file and enter the following:
  
```
heimdall flash --VBMETA /path/to/vbmeta.img
```

Replace "/path/to/" with the actual folder location of your vbmeta.img file.


That's it!
